"Way of Bodhisattva" Art Series Grant Application for Fractal Visions Mission #1

Applicant: artist Yura Miron

Duration: Mon, 01 Apr 2024 - Wed, 01 May 2024

Introduction:

The series "Way of Bodhisattva'' is a vivid and intricately detailed collection of artworks that draws inspiration from "The Way of the Bodhisattva (Bodhicharyavatara)" by Shantideva, an 8th-century Indian Buddhist monk and scholar at Nalanda. Shantideva's text is a guide to cultivating the mind of enlightenment (bodhicitta) and to becoming a Bodhisattva, a being who strives toward awakening and compassion for the benefit of all sentient beings. Reflecting the profound teachings, the art series often features ethereal figures embodying serenity, compassion, and wisdom. Through the use of otherworldly landscapes, symbolic elements, and a sense of interconnectedness among the figures, the series invites contemplation on the virtues and path of the Bodhisattva, encouraging a deeper understanding and appreciation of this compassionate way of life.
